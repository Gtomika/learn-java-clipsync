# Learn Java ClipSync

The clipsync server is in development, currently not working...

This is the application for synchronizing the clipboard of your android phone, and your computer.
It's meant to use with my [Learn Java app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gaspar.learnjava).

Supported syncing modes:
- With Bluetooth.
- Through local network.

## Requirements

Your computer must have *Java* installed, as this is a *JavaFX* application.

I suppose you already installed *Java*, since you're using the Learn Java application.

## Bluetooth syncing

To use this mode, both your phone and your computer must have bluotooth support. 
It should work for Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Local network syncing

To use this mode, both your phone and our computer must be on the same local network, for example 
on the same *WiFi*.
