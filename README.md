# Learn Java ClipSync

This is the application for sending code samples from your android phone to your computer.
It's meant to use with my [Learn Java app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gaspar.learnjava).

## Requirements

Your computer must have *Java* installed, as this is a *JavaFX* application.

I suppose you already installed *Java*, since you're using the Learn Java application.

## Bluetooth syncing

To use this mode, both your phone and your computer must have bluotooth support. 
It should work for Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Local network syncing

To use this mode, both your phone and our computer must be on the same local network, for example 
on the same *WiFi*.
