# Learn Java ClipSync

The clipsync server is in development...

Supported syncing modes:
- With Bluetooth
- Through local network.

## Requirements

Your computer must have *Java* installed, as this is a *JavaFX* application.

I suppose you already installed *Java*, since you're using the Learn Java application.

## Bluetooth syncing

To use this mode, both your phone and your computer must have bluotooth support.

## Local network syncing

To use this mode, both your phone and our computer must be on the same local network, for example 
on the same *WiFi*.
